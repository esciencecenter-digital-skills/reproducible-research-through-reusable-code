## Challenge: How reproducible and reusable is your project?

### 1. Share your project
Share the link to your GitHub project with one of your peers.

### 2. Review the reproducibility of someone else's project

Review the reprodubility of the project of one of your peers. 
[Open a new GitHub issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/creating-an-issue) in the project you are reviewing in which you answer these questions: 
- Is the code clearly documented and can you reproduce and reuse the code?  
- Are you able to rerun the analysis independently? 

    - Note: in case of computationally intensive projects, it might be better to partially rerun 
    the analysis (or with fewer repetitions or permutations if needed)

- Which improvements do you suggest to make the code as clear as possible?

:::

If you want your project to be more thoroughly checked for (computational) reproducibility,
you can consider submitting your data and code to [Reprohack](https://www.reprohack.org){target="_blank"} 
or [CODECHECK](https://codecheck.org.uk/){target="_blank"}. 
Even if you donâ€™t, it would be helpful to take into account their guidelines: 
both initiatives emphasize that documentation of your code is key!

- A check by another pair of eyes is the best way to learn how reproducible and reusable your code is
