:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- How reproducible and reusable is your project?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Have your project checked for reproducibility and reusability. 
- Check a project for reproducibility and reusability.

::: challenge
## How reproducible and reusable is your project?

Share the link to your GitHub project with a peer during the workshop. Ask them to answer the
following questions:

- Is the code clearly documented and do they know how to reproduce and reuse the code?  

- Are they able to rerun your analysis independently? 

    - Note: in case of computationally intensive projects, it might be better to partially rerun 
    the analysis (or with fewer repetitions or permutations if needed)

- Which improvements do they suggest to make the code as clear as possible?

:::

If you want your project to be more thoroughly checked for (computational) reproducibility,
you can consider submitting your data and code to [Reprohack](https://www.reprohack.org){target="_blank"} 
or [CODECHECK](https://codecheck.org.uk/){target="_blank"}. 
Even if you donâ€™t, it would be helpful to take into account their guidelines: 
both initiatives emphasize that documentation of your code is key!


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- A check by another pair of eyes is the best way to learn how reproducible and reusable your code is
